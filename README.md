## Course Intro and Resources

Welcome to "Quick-Quiz-App with HTML, CSS, and JS".

we are going to use fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to build a quiz application. This application will be able to load questions from a 3rd party API, track and display high scores, and so much more! I store High score in Local Storage, create animations, use modern ES6 JavaScript features, and more.
